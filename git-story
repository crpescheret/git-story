There once was a man named Larry.
Larry went to the grocery store.
Larry bought milk, cheese and yogurt.
Larry was sad because Larry is lactose intolerant.
Larry returned his lactose and got some good old fashioned vegetables.
But Larry has a huge sweet tooth and is mildly masochistic so he got a huge tub of ice cream too.
